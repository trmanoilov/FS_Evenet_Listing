# FS_Evenet_Listing

Coding challenge

A new custom post type for Events
The custom post type needs to have a few custom fields:
- event date (date picker)
- event location
- URL for the event

We need an archive page which will list all events, ordered by event date. <br/>
Each event should have a title, location (you can add a Google map integration), event date, a link to the external source/site. <br/>
We need to have a simple "Add to Google Calendar" button, which will add the event to your google calendar. <br/>
